# Astro Personal Page

I'm using mainly Astro and Tailwind to create this website as it's essentially a static site. It uses Astro's ability to create collections and convert Markdown files into HTML to dynamically generate content which can be easily modified. It's based off of [this Astro template](https://github.com/Ladvace/astro-bento-portfolio).
