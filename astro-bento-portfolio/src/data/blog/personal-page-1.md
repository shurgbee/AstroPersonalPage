# Hello All!

This is my first real foray into [Astro](https://astro.build) and into webhosting with Cloudflare. I really enjoyed making this website, as it showed me how you can leverage Astro's lightweight nature to make separated components that work together (and aren't limited to react). Cloudflare was also very easy to setup and didn't feel like it was trying to overwhelm me with options in an effort to squeeze more out of me
